# Snippy ✂️

Snippy is a simple and handy snippet management web app built using **Next.js**.  
This project was created as a learning experience to explore and implement core features of Next.js such as:

- ✅ File-based routing  
- 🔁 Dynamic routing  
- ⚠️ Error handling with not-found pages  
- ⚙️ `generateStaticParams` for static generation

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **Framework**: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Ui**: Shadcn

## 🧠 What I Learned

- How Next.js automatically creates routes based on the file structure.
- Setting up dynamic routes using `[slug]` and handling nested paths.
- Creating custom 404 error pages.
- Using `generateStaticParams` with dynamic routes for static site generation (SSG).
